# hello-world
Following the "What is GitHub?" tutorial and this is the first project.
I am creating a GitHub account, even though I have no previous coding experience, because I would like to learn Python and need a place to practice.  I am hoping that I can learn enough that I can create some simple data management programs and maybe get a job in the biocomputing department of the company I currently work for.
